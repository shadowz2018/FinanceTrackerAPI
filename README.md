Finance Tracker API

This is the first project I have made involving API's, Bootstrap, and Angular10 

The goal of this project was to make a finance tracker where the user could add,edit,update, and delete 
finances and catorgies of said finances through a webpage made by Angular10 with the API's made by .NET Core and SQL server.

I first started by making two tables in SQL server, which I have used before, with the tables being Catorgies and Finances.

I then went to Visual Studio to make a .NET Core API from the SQL Server through local hosting. I used postman to regularly check
if the API's were running correctly.

I then went to visual studio code to make the angular10 project. This was the hard part for me. I started by making components 
for both the Catorgies and Finances with both show and add/edit components for both of the tables.
I then routed the components to the Html to show them on the webpage. I then ended up with several errors that I did not know how to fix.
I am at a stopping point, as I do not know how to fix said bugs.

I will look at this project later in the future, as I want to learn more about frontend development.
I only had angular10 docs and some YouTube tutorial help.
I spent 8-10 hours over three different days.

What I learned:
API's
Bootstrap
Angular10
.NET Core
and that breaks are nice

I hope this project is a good representation of my technical skills.
